A Simple Python Application for stock Screening and portfolio Tracking, far from being a Financial Modeller in the true sense of the word, I might add more features later on, as per any suggestions provided. The charts don't update per minute/per hour/ but rather whenever a user logs into their session. Threading is also another thing that I struggle with and so this is only a single threaded application and so, the window will freeze during all processes, so please take your time with it. Thank you.
Also I don't know about traditional coding/github practices, but I would like to thank people maintaining libraries such as PySide6, Pandas, finplots, and many others, for making this so much easier.
